We get an .pcapng- and an .html-file.
The HTML-file contains the "keypad" used to input the flag. It also contains some javascript data.
The .pcapng-file is a wireshark file. It contains USB data.
In the second package we find the device ID: DualSense wireless controller (PS5)
After some configuration steps we get what we can asume are the input packages. Let's export those to .json so we can interact using python.
I found the USB protocol specifications here: https://controllers.fandom.com/wiki/Sony_DualSense
In the documentation we read that 0x01 is report bit. And it does seem that all packages start with 0x01, so we can skip it.
The remaining length is 63 as specified in the specsheet. We are interested in the adresses for the buttons and the dpad: 7.0 - 7.6.
