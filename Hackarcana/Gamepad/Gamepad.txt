We get an .pcapng- and an .html-file.
The HTML-file contains the "keypad" used to input the flag. It also contains some javascript data.
The .pcapng-file is a wireshark file. It contains USB data.
In the second package we find the device ID: DualSense wireless controller (PS5)
After some configuration steps we get what we can asume are the input packages. Let's export those to .json so we can interact using python.
I found the USB protocol specifications here: https://controllers.fandom.com/wiki/Sony_DualSense
In the documentation we read that 0x01 is report bit. And it does seem that all packages start with 0x01, so we can skip it.
The remaining length is 63 as specified in the specsheet. We are interested in the adresses for the buttons and the dpad and buttons: 7.0 - 7.7.
We look when every button is pressed by isolating the byte and shifting it for each button.
We have a lot of duplicates because of the high poll rate, so we check if the current packet is the same as the previous one. If so ignore it.
We can copy paste the keyboard layout in a variable and translate the dpad moves to x,y co√∂rdinates. Make sure each line is 10 characters long.
With "assert" we check which buttons get pressed. Both cross and circle are used. Only circle seems to yield our flag so cross is possibly a red harring.
